I recently completed a Sales Analysis Dashboard project using Microsoft Excel, leveraging three interconnected datasets: Products, Orders, and Customers. The goal was to transform raw data into a visually engaging and interactive dashboard that provides meaningful business insights at a glance.

Key Tools & Techniques Used:

Data Cleaning & Transformation using Power Query Editor

Data Modeling through Pivot Tables

Dynamic Visualizations with Pivot Charts and Slicers

KPI Metrics such as Total Revenue, Average Order Value, and Delivery Time

ðŸ“ˆ Insights Highlighted:

Top revenue-generating occasions and categories

Sales trends by month and hour

Best-selling products and highest-performing cities by order count

The final dashboard enables stakeholders to slice data by occasion, order date, and delivery date, making decision-making both faster and smarter.
